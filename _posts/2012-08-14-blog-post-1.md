Deep Learning projects sometimes look messy and don’t follow a certain structure. People get into the problem and compete over getting good results. Usually, given the nature of the task, we don’t get the time to think much about the project structure or the code modularity. After working with different deep learning projects and facing problems with files organization and code repetition, we came up with a simple project structure built with PyTorch.

We are proposing a baseline for any PyTorch project to give you a quick start, where you will get the time to focus on your model's implementation and we will handle the rest. We are:

Providing a scalable project structure, with a template file for each component.
Introducing the usage of a config file that handle all the hyper-parameters related to a certain problem.
Embedding examples from various problems inside the template, where you can run any of them independently with a single change in the config file name.
How is all this happening? Let’s see.
