I am a first-year MSc student of Computing Science at the University of Alberta, supervised by Matthew Taylor at the [RLAI](http://rlai.ualberta.ca/) lab. My research interests are machine learning, representation learning and reinforcement learning as an approach to building general-purpose AI agents, with previous research experience in computer vision and deep learning.
