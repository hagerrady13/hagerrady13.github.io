I am a second-year MSc student of Computing Science at University of Alberta, supervised by Matthew Taylor at the [RLAI](http://rlai.ualberta.ca/) lab, affiliated with [AMII](https://www.amii.ca/). My research interests are reinforcement learning and machine learning with a current focus on offline and off-policy learning. My previous research experience in computer vision and deep learning.
